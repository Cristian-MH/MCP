# 🧠 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Projects

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains a collection of **C# projects** that explore and implement the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — a standard for enabling AI models and developer tools to interact with external systems through structured, context-aware clients.

Each subproject in this repository represents a different **MCP client**, designed to integrate with real-world platforms and APIs such as GitHub, Jira, Firebase, and Azure.  
The goal is to demonstrate **how MCP can bridge AI reasoning and software ecosystems** through modular, reusable components.
